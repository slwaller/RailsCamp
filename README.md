This project was built basically for jumpstarting my knowledge back into Rails after being away from it for a bit!


## Installation

Make sure you have Ruby and Ruby on Rails! You can find out how to get started [here](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#creating-a-new-rails-project)


`git clone https://github.com/slwaller/RailsCamp`

`bundle install`
